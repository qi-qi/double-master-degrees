`Programme Description`
- The Erasmus Mundus European Master in Distributed Computing was approved by the EU-commission in July 2009. It is a cooperation between Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden, Instituto Superior Tecnologico (IST) in Portugal and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). It is a two-year Master's programme including built-in mobility for the students. The EMDC aims at giving the best possible foundation for a career in research and development of scalable and reliable distributed systems. After the program, students should not only understand and be able to use large distributed systems but they should be capable of designing and constructing such systems. The programme comprises three semesters of course work and one semester for thesis work, 120 ECTS in total. For the first year of studies, students enter at IST or UPC, where courses cover the core aspects of distributed computing with tailored specializations. The specific profiles offered at IST and UPC address two different sets of concerns in design, development, evaluation, and evolution of distributed computing systems: overall system reliability at IST (fault-tolerance, interoperability, autonomic systems), performance and scalability at UPC (performance measurement, tuning, large-scale systems). The third semester is completed at KTH and contains advanced courses that integrate the contents of previous semesters. This motivates students to develop large-scale projects integrating both common and complementary skills acquired earlier, and developing research methodology and scientific writing, essential to pursue further studies and research. The programme concludes with a master’s thesis supervised by one of the three institutions.
